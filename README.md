# Drawer Menu - Profixy


![Preview-Screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernalvinicius/DrawerMenu/master/src/assets/images/print.png)



## Why?



This project is part of the selection process for Front-End Developer sent by **Profixy**.



The challenge is to make a Menu Drawer. As much as possible, I tried to be faithful to the design provided.

## Some Observations about this App



1 - In this link on the [codesendbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/trusting-dirac-5h2ji?file=/src/index.js) you can look the web part from this application. I had a problem with the implementation of *Animated.View* on the web and was unable to resolve it in time. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/soCck7L.png) you can see how to simulate *IPhone X* on the web.



## Functionalities



- The only requested functionality was a Menu that opened with the click of a button, the biggest challenges were to create the page rotation effect when opening the menu and also adding border radius in Drawer.
